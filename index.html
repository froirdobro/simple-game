			<h1>Welcome to my game</h1>
			<p>This is a very simple game! The only objective is constantly change the ball direction and avoid the obstacles with the pass of time!<br>
			The longer you survive, the higher score you get.<br>
			The game will over as soon as the ball hits one of the many obstacles<br>
			To control the direction of the ball just press Space bar<br>
			The ball also bounces when it hit the borders, this can be used as an advantage but it can also be your worst enemy!</p>
